# Movie Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth **analysis of a movie dataset** to extract meaningful insights about films, genres, ratings, popularity, and other related attributes.  
The dataset used in this project was **collected through web scraping and/or external sources**, then cleaned and analyzed using Python.

The notebook demonstrates **data collection, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using a real-world movie dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect movie-related data using web scraping techniques
- Clean and preprocess raw movie data
- Analyze trends related to genres, ratings, and popularity
- Visualize insights using charts and graphs

---

## 🌐 Data Collection (Web Scraping)
- Movie data was gathered using **web scraping techniques**
- Relevant movie information such as titles, ratings, genres, and release details was extracted
- Scraped data was stored and processed using Pandas for further analysis

*(Scraping tools or methods may include BeautifulSoup, requests, or similar libraries)*

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset is loaded directly in the notebook
- Contains information such as:
  - Movie titles
  - Genres
  - Ratings
  - Release year
  - Popularity or vote counts

*(Exact columns may vary depending on the dataset used)*
